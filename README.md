# customer_segmentation03_website-purchase
This part combines both website behavior and purchase behavior of customers.

The features used for this analysis include the segmentation obtained from website behavior analysis 
and from the purchase behavior to form a combined segment.

The visalization mostly used was heatmap to check the correlation between the website categories of active, casual and bouncers vistors
with that of purchase behaviors of vip, loyal and casual shoppers.... a combined segment was created by merging both categories for further analysis.
